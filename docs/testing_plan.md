### Testing Plan

**Overall Goal:** Ensure the VRChat event calendar scraping script is robust, accurate, and maintainable.

**Phases:**

1.  **Setup & Environment Preparation:**
    *   **Goal:** Prepare the development environment for testing.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   [ ] Verify that all dependencies are installed (Playwright, `cryptography`, etc.) by checking `requirements.txt` and running `pip install -r requirements.txt` if needed.
        *   [ ] Configure necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys for Gemini API, login credentials) in `config/main_config.yaml` or as environment variables.
        *   [ ] Set up Playwright tracing by installing browser binaries: `playwright install`.
    *   **Testing:**
        *   [ ] Confirm that the script can be run without errors related to missing dependencies or incorrect configuration.

2.  **Short-Term Fixes Testing:**
    *   **Goal:** Test the implementation of the short-term fixes outlined in `next_steps.md` and detailed in `revised_plan.md`.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   [ ] **Implement Complete Login Handling:**
            *   [ ] Run the script with valid login credentials.
            *   [ ] Verify successful login by checking for expected elements on the page after login.
            *   [ ] Run the script without login credentials.
            *   [ ] Confirm that the script prompts for credentials or uses a default/guest mode.
            *   [ ] Enable 2-factor authentication for the test account.
            *   [ ] Verify that the script correctly handles the 2FA challenge.
            *   [ ] Check that login sessions (cookies) are saved and reloaded correctly.
        *   [ ] **Implement Data Validation and Error Handling:**
            *   [ ] Run the script with various queries and lists.
            *   [ ] Verify that data is validated and errors are handled correctly.
            *   [ ] Check for clear error logs when data is missing or invalid.
            *   [ ] Confirm that the script exits with a non-zero exit code (e.g., 1) when critical errors occur.
            *   [ ] Check file size limits in `save_data` method.
            *   [ ] Verify that saved JSON files are reloaded and checked for emptiness.
            *   [ ] Ensure that extracted tweets have all required fields (`tweet_id`, `text`, `url`, `date`).
        *   [ ] **Enable Playwright Tracing:**
            *   [ ] Run the script with the `--trace` flag: `python playwright_scraper.py --trace`.
            *   [ ] Verify that a `trace.zip` file is generated.
            *   [ ] Open the `trace.zip` file in the Playwright inspector and examine the trace for any issues.
        *   [ ] **Implement Appropriate Waiting Processes:**
            *   [ ] Execute the scraping script and observe the execution time and element loading behavior.
            *   [ ] Confirm that it is more efficient than using `time.sleep()`.
            *   [ ] Use `page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")` to periodically save screenshots and visually confirm that all elements are loading correctly.
        *   [ ] **Implement Robust Locators:**
            *   [ ] Execute the scraping script and confirm that data is extracted accurately.
            *   [ ] Verify the accuracy and completeness of the extracted data, especially for different types of tweets (with images, videos, links, etc.).
            *   [ ] Intentionally modify the DOM structure of X.com (e.g., change CSS class names) and ensure that the script continues to work.
        *   [ ] **Enhance Scrolling Process:**
            *   [ ] Execute the scraping script and verify that it scrolls through a large number of tweets.
            *   [ ] Confirm that scrolling does not stop prematurely.

3.  **Medium-Term Improvements Testing:**
    *   **Goal:** Test the implementation of medium-term improvements.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   [ ] **Enhance Data Extraction:**
            *   [ ] Run the script and verify that additional tweet attributes (images, embedded links, hashtags, etc.) are extracted correctly.
            *   [ ] Check the accuracy and completeness of the extracted data.
        *   [ ] **Implement Error Recovery Mechanisms:**
            *   [ ] Simulate network errors and timeouts to test the error handling and retry logic.
            *   [ ] Verify that the script retries failed requests with exponential backoff.
            *   [ ] Implement alternative scraping strategies (different queries, different approaches) and test their effectiveness.

4.  **Long-Term Improvements Testing (if applicable):**
    *   **Goal:** Test the implementation of long-term improvements.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   [ ] **Implement Distributed Scraping Architecture:**
            *   [ ] Deploy the distributed scraping architecture to a test environment.
            *   [ ] Verify that the system can collect data from multiple sources concurrently.
            *   [ ] Monitor the system's performance and scalability.
        *   [ ] **Implement AI Data Enhancement Pipeline:**
            *   [ ] Run the data processing pipeline and verify that the Gemini API is called correctly.
            *   [ ] Check the accuracy and completeness of the enhanced event data.
        *   [ ] **Implement Monitoring and Alerting System:**
            *   [ ] Deploy the monitoring and alerting system to a test environment.
            *   [ ] Simulate errors and verify that alerts are triggered correctly.

5.  **Documentation & Reporting:**
    *   **Goal:** Document the testing process and report the results.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   [ ] Document all test cases, procedures, and results.
        *   [ ] Create a summary report of the testing process, including any issues found and recommendations for improvement.

**Testing Tools:**

*   Playwright Inspector: For debugging and inspecting the DOM.
*   pytest: For writing and running unit tests.
*   Logging: Use the logging module to record events and errors during testing.
*   Screenshots: Capture screenshots to visually verify the state of the page during testing.

**Note:** This plan assumes that the code has been written and is ready for testing. If the code is not yet complete, the plan should be adjusted accordingly.
