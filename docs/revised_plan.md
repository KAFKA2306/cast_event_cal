## Twitter/VRChat Event Playwright Scraping Module - Revised Plan

This document outlines the revised plan for improving the Twitter/VRChat event Playwright scraping module.

### 1. Goals

*   Address current issues with login failures and element detection failures.
*   Improve the robustness and maintainability of the codebase.
*   Enhance anti-bot measures to avoid detection and rate limiting.
*   Implement proxy rotation for IP blocking mitigation.
*   Improve error handling and logging.
*   Enhance code structure and testability.

### 3. Implementation Details

*   **Code Backup:** Create a backup of the existing code before making any changes.
*   **Refactor: Playwright API:** Rewrite the scraping module to use Playwright's native API, replacing the custom `AdaptiveSelectors`.
*   **Anti-Bot Measures:** Implement anti-bot measures to avoid detection.
*   **Proxy/IP Rotation:** Implement proxy rotation to avoid IP blocking.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to automatically recover from failures.
*   **Code Structure/Testing:** Improve the code structure and add automated tests.
*   **Configuration:** Externalize configuration values to YAML/ENV files.
*   **Documentation:** Update the documentation to reflect the changes.
*   **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect and respond to errors.

### 4. Clarifying Questions and Answers

*   **What are the specific types of login failures encountered, and what specific elements are failing to be detected and on which pages?** (Answer not yet provided)
*   **What is the current testing strategy, and what are its limitations? What are the key operational bottlenecks beyond login/element detection failures?** Testing: basic unit tests, bottlenecks: rate limiting
*   **Are there any specific ethical considerations or legal constraints related to data scraping that need to be addressed?** No specific considerations

### 5. Next Steps

The next step is to switch to code mode and begin implementing the changes outlined in this plan.
